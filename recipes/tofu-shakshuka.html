        <h3>About this dish</h3>
        <p>Shakshuka is known as an easy and healthy breakfast option in many countries, but it can definitely be enjoyed at any time during the day. We gave our own plant-based spin to the classic dish and used silken tofu, which provides a very <strong>"eggy"</strong> feel to that of the traditional Shakshuka, especially when combined with kala namak salt.</p>
